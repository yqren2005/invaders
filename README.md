# invaders
A terminal game written in Rust

This is the final project of an online Rust course I took.

## How to play:
Download all the files and run: cargo run in your terminal

For the sounds to work we need install some packages.

### Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config

### Fedora/Red Hat:
sudo yum install -y alsa-lib-devel
